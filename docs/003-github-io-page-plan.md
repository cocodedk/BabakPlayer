# GitHub.io Published Page Plan (BabakPlayer)

## 1. Objective
1. Design the public page users see on `github.io` for `BabakPlayer`.
2. Make the page explicitly reference `BabakCast` as its companion app.
3. Explicitly include:
   - `Babak Bandpey`
   - `Cocode`
4. Make the published page visually beautiful (neon-tech, premium, responsive).

## 2. Published Page Content (What Visitors Must See)
1. Hero headline + one-line value proposition.
2. Clear relationship section: `BabakCast -> BabakPlayer`.
3. Feature highlights for import, ordered playback, and purge controls.
4. Privacy/local-first trust section.
5. About section naming `Babak Bandpey` and `Cocode`.
6. CTA buttons to GitHub repo and APK/release location.

## 3. Visual Direction for the Published Page
1. Cinematic dark backdrop with layered neon gradients.
2. Neon cyan + pink + amber accent system.
3. Glass-style cards with glow borders.
4. Strong typography hierarchy for hero and section headings.
5. Subtle reveal/hover motion that stays lightweight.

## 4. Page Sections (Final Layout)
1. Hero
2. Companion Flow (BabakCast to BabakPlayer)
3. Core Features
4. Privacy & Local Storage
5. About Creator & Company

## 5. Copy Constraints
1. Must contain phrase equivalent to: “Companion app for BabakCast”.
2. Must mention: “Created by Babak Bandpey”.
3. Must mention: “Built by Cocode”.

## 6. Technical Delivery (How It Reaches GitHub.io)
1. Implement the final page in `website/index.html` + `website/styles.css`.
2. Push changes to `main`.
3. Existing workflow deploys that content to GitHub Pages.
4. Verify the final live page URL and visual output.

## 7. QA for the Live Page
1. Mobile + desktop layout quality.
2. Readability/contrast in dark neon design.
3. All required mentions present (BabakCast, Babak Bandpey, Cocode).
4. CTA links valid and reachable.

## 8. Execution Steps
1. Finalize exact public copy blocks.
2. Build page structure and sections.
3. Apply neon design system and motion.
